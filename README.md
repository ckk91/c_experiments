# C experiments
Originally trying to learn C by building a lisp interpreter and to get a grasp of lower-level programming. Became a bit of a dumping ground with learnings on ways of how to misuse a computer(tm). Taught me the hard way a machine works at a lower level, how to program somewhat more defensively and gave me a new appreciation for higher level languages. I still like the language though and will probably play around some more with it.
